Good! I'm in the mood for flesh.
Here comes one now. Welcome, fool!
How, dare, you!
You won't escape this with your life.
Shall I eat you and enslave your kin?
Don't make me chase you!
There is no room for you in my plans.
You will regret your trespasses here.
Your end is up.
Cook you and gnaw you, I will!
